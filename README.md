# credit-risk-classification

This machine learning model reviews several features such as loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income, number of accounts, derogatory marks and total debt to identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. Using logistic regression, it predicts whether the loan status will be high-risk or healthy.

Metric scores for healthy loans:
-- Precision: 1.00
-- Recall: 1.00
-- f1-score: 1.00

Metric scores for high-risk loans:
-- Precision: 0.85
-- Recall: 0.91
-- f1-score: 0.88

Overall, the model performed very well and predicts healthy loans with 100% accuracy. I would recommend this model to the company, but I would also recommend gathering more data on high-risk loans because there is a significant imbalance between the labels which is causing the model to perform a slightly more poorly when it comes to predicting high-risk loans.
